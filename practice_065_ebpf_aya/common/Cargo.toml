# ============================================================================
# Common crate: shared types between BPF (kernel) and userspace
#
# This crate MUST be #![no_std] compatible because it is compiled both for:
# - bpfel-unknown-none (kernel BPF programs — no std, no heap, no alloc)
# - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (userspace — full std available)
#
# Types defined here are used to communicate via BPF maps (e.g., structs
# written in kernel and read in userspace via PerfEventArray or RingBuf).
#
# IMPORTANT: All types must be #[repr(C)] to ensure consistent memory layout
# across the two different compilation targets.
