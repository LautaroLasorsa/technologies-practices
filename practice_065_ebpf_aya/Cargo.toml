# ============================================================================
# Workspace root for eBPF practice
#
# This workspace contains three crates:
# - common/     : Shared types between BPF and userspace (#![no_std] compatible)
# - ebpf/       : BPF programs (compiled to bpfel-unknown-none, runs in kernel)
# - userspace/  : Userspace loader (loads BPF programs, manages maps, displays output)
#
# NOTE: The ebpf/ crate is NOT a regular workspace member — it targets a different
# architecture (bpfel-unknown-none) and uses nightly Rust with -Zbuild-std.
# It is compiled separately by the build-ebpf alias (see .cargo/config.toml).
# Only 'common' and 'userspace' are workspace members.
