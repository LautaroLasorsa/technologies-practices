# io-uring and tokio-uring are Linux-only. This project is compiled inside
# a Docker container (see Dockerfile). Do NOT try to build on Windows/macOS.

[dependencies]
# Low-level io_uring bindings: IoUring, opcode builders, squeue/cqueue entries.
# This crate wraps liburing and the raw io_uring_setup/io_uring_enter syscalls.
# Version 0.7.x is the latest stable series.
io-uring = "0.7"

# Async runtime built on io_uring. Provides tokio-compatible async APIs
# (File, TcpListener, TcpStream) backed by io_uring instead of epoll.
# IMPORTANT: tokio-uring has its own runtime (`tokio_uring::start()`),
# it is NOT a drop-in addition to standard tokio.
tokio-uring = "0.5"

# Standard tokio runtime — used ONLY in Exercise 6 for benchmarking
# io_uring vs epoll-based async I/O. The "full" feature enables
# tokio::fs, tokio::net, macros, and the multi-thread runtime.
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

# libc provides raw type definitions (iovec, sockaddr_in, etc.) needed
# for low-level io_uring operations with fixed buffers.
libc = "0.2"
