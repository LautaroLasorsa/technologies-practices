# configmap.yaml — Stores non-sensitive configuration as key-value pairs.
#
# ── Exercise Context ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This exercise teaches the 12-factor principle of externalizing configuration.
# Separating config from container images enables reusing the same image across
# environments (dev/staging/prod) with different ConfigMaps -- critical for GitOps workflows.
#
# Concepts to learn:
#   - ConfigMaps decouple configuration from container images
#   - Values are stored as plain text (NOT for passwords or secrets)
#   - Can be consumed as environment variables or mounted as files
#   - Must be created BEFORE the Pod/Deployment that references it
#

  # Syntax is simple:
