# pod.yaml — A bare Pod running the task-tracker container.
#
# ── Exercise Context ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This exercise teaches the foundational structure of Kubernetes manifests:
# apiVersion, kind, metadata, and spec. Understanding bare Pods clarifies why
# higher-level controllers (Deployments) are necessary for production workloads.
#
# Concepts to learn:
#   - apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec — the four top-level fields of every K8s object
#   - containerPort is informational (documentation), not a firewall rule
#   - imagePullPolicy: Never — tells K8s to use the local image (built inside minikube)
#   - A bare Pod has NO self-healing: if it dies, nothing restarts it
#
# Docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  # TODO(human): Give this pod a name. Use "task-tracker".
  # name: ???
  labels:
    # TODO(human): Add a label "app: task-tracker" so selectors can find this pod.
    # Labels are key-value pairs — think of them as tags for filtering.
    # Hint: app: task-tracker
spec:
  containers:
    # TODO(human): Define a single container with:
    #   - name: task-tracker
    #   - image: task-tracker:v1
    #   - imagePullPolicy: Never   (use the local image, don't pull from a registry)
    #   - containerPort: 5000      (inside the "ports" list)
    #
    # Structure:
    #   - name: <container-name>
    #     image: <image:tag>
    #     imagePullPolicy: Never
    #     ports:
    #       - containerPort: <port>
