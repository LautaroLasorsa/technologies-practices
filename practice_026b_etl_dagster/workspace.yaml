# Dagster workspace configuration
# This tells Dagster where to find your code (Definitions object).
#
# COMPARISON WITH AIRFLOW:
# - Airflow scans a `dags/` folder for Python files containing DAG objects.
# - Dagster loads a single Definitions object from a Python file.
#   This is more explicit: you control exactly what's registered.
