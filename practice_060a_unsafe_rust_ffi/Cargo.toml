[features]
# Enable bindgen to auto-generate Rust bindings from C headers.
# Requires LLVM/libclang installed on the system.
# On Windows: install LLVM from https://releases.llvm.org/ and set
# LIBCLANG_PATH=C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin (adjust path as needed).
#
# Usage: cargo build --features bindgen
# Without this feature, Exercise 6 uses pre-written fallback bindings.
bindgen = ["dep:bindgen"]

[dependencies]
# libc provides raw type definitions for C interop: c_int, c_char, c_void, size_t, etc.
# Also provides access to POSIX functions (strlen, qsort, free, etc.)
libc = "0.2"

[build-dependencies]
# cc compiles C source files into a static library linked into the Rust binary.
# It auto-detects the system C compiler (MSVC on Windows, gcc/clang on Linux/macOS).
cc = "1"

# bindgen parses C header files and generates Rust FFI declarations automatically.
# Optional: requires libclang (LLVM). Set LIBCLANG_PATH if not on PATH.
# Enable with: cargo build --features bindgen
bindgen = { version = "0.71", optional = true }
