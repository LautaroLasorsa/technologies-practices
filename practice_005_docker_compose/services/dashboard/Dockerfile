# ── Exercise Context ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This exercise consolidates your Dockerfile skills by implementing a third
# service with slight variations (different port). Repetition with minor changes
# builds muscle memory for real-world multi-service projects.

# TODO(human) [1/4]: Choose a base image.
# Hint: Same as the other services -- python:3.12-slim.


# TODO(human) [2/4]: Set the working directory.


# TODO(human) [3/4]: Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies.


# TODO(human) [4/4]: Copy source and define the startup command.
# Hint: Similar to API Gateway but on port 8001.
# Syntax:
#   COPY . .
#   EXPOSE 8001
#   CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8001"]
