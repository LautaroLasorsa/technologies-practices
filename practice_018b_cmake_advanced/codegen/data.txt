Practice 018b: Advanced CMake
==============================

This text was embedded into the C++ binary at BUILD TIME
using add_custom_command() and a CMake script.

Key CMake features demonstrated:
  1. CMake Presets (CMakePresets.json)
  2. Toolchain files (cross-compilation)
  3. Custom Find modules (FindMyMath.cmake)
  4. CTest (labels, fixtures, properties)
  5. Custom commands (this file!)
  6. CPack (packaging)

If you can read this at runtime, the code generation pipeline works.
