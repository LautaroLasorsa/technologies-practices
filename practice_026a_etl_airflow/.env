# Airflow Docker Compose environment variables
#
# AIRFLOW_UID: The user ID that Airflow containers run as.
# On Linux, set this to your host UID (run `id -u`) so that files
# created inside containers have correct ownership on the host.
# On Windows/macOS with Docker Desktop, 50000 is fine.

# These are also set in docker-compose.yml via x-airflow-common,
# but .env serves as a quick reference and override point.
