[dependencies]
# tokio: Production async runtime with work-stealing scheduler, I/O driver, timers, channels.
# "full" enables all features: rt-multi-thread, macros, sync, time, io-util, net, etc.
# We need "full" because exercises explore runtime configuration, channels, time, and macros.
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }

# futures: Utility traits and combinators for the Future ecosystem.
# Provides FutureExt, StreamExt, channel primitives, and the core Future re-exports.
# We use it for the `futures::future::poll_fn` helper and combinator utilities.
futures = "0.3"

# pin-project-lite: Lightweight declarative macro for safe pinned struct projections.
# Used in Exercise 4 to build future combinators that wrap inner (pinned) futures.
# Unlike pin-project (proc-macro), this uses declarative macros — faster compile, no syn dep.
pin-project-lite = "0.2"
