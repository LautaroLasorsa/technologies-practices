# The workspace contains projects targeting different architectures:
#
#   wasi-hello  → wasm32-wasip1         (cargo build -p wasi-hello --target wasm32-wasip1)
#   wasm-lib    → wasm32-unknown-unknown (cargo build -p wasm-lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown)
#   wasm-host   → native                (cargo build -p wasm-host)
#
# Running `cargo check` at workspace root checks only the native-compatible
# projects. Use the target-specific commands above for WASM sub-projects.
