# This crate is a binary targeting wasm32-wasip1.
# Build with: cargo build -p wasi-hello --target wasm32-wasip1
#
# It uses only the Rust standard library, which provides WASI bindings
# automatically when targeting wasm32-wasip1 (std::fs, std::io, std::env
# all route through WASI syscalls).
#
# No external dependencies needed — the std library handles everything.
