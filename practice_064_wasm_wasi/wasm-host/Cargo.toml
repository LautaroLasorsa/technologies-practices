# This crate is a native binary that embeds the wasmtime WebAssembly runtime.
# It loads and executes .wasm modules, acting as the "host" that provides
# capabilities to sandboxed WASM "guest" modules.
#
# Build and run with: cargo run -p wasm-host
#
# NOTE: wasmtime is a large dependency (~3 min first compile). Subsequent
# builds are fast due to incremental compilation.

[dependencies]
# wasmtime: the core embedding API for the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime.
# Provides Engine, Store, Module, Linker, Instance, TypedFunc.
# Default features include cranelift (compiler), wat (text format parsing),
# and component-model support.
wasmtime = "29"

# wasmtime-wasi: WASI implementation for wasmtime.
# Provides WasiCtxBuilder, add_to_linker_sync, and all WASI Preview 1 APIs
# (filesystem, clocks, random, stdio).
wasmtime-wasi = "29"

# anyhow: ergonomic error handling (wasmtime returns anyhow-compatible errors)
anyhow = "1"
