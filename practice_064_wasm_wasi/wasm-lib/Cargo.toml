# This crate is a library targeting wasm32-unknown-unknown (browser WASM).
#
# Build options:
#   Raw WASM:     cargo build -p wasm-lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
#   With JS glue: wasm-pack build wasm-lib --target web
#
# The crate-type "cdylib" tells cargo to produce a .wasm file (when targeting WASM)
# or a .so/.dll (when targeting native). For WASM libraries, cdylib is required.
